Wiki . 
This is a Game created using pygame and tileset , assets are primarily obtained from OpenGameArt
. I will keep updating as the game takes better shape .
I have not thought about any concept yet :( . 

Clone it in desktop , configure GAMECONFIG.xml for custom map , run gameconfig.py , it generates loadable.py
Run main.py to start the animation [its not a 'game' yet :( ]; 
	
Code Flow:
Specify Configurations in GAMECONFIG.xml ; run game_config.py , it generates a loadable.py 
which creates the location of assests, other details that are required to create characters and objects in the game .

I will be following google's python coding guidelines to make it easier for people (Me,mostly) to work later on :)
There s this wonderful pylint which is run on the code and patches before being committed :)
Cross platform compatibility.
